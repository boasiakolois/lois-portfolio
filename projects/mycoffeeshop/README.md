# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project



- Iâ€™d love to add smooth scroll behavior and simple scroll-triggered animations to make the site feel more interactive.
- Iâ€™m thinking about building a mobile-friendly version so it looks great on phones and tablets too.
- It would be fun to add a small JavaScript featureâ€”like a pop-up confirmation when someone books a table, or maybe a light/dark mode toggle.
- I also want to clean up the code a bit more and make sure everything follows best practices (like BEM naming and accessibility improvements).
- Finallyâ€¦ maybe a secret hover animation on the coffee cup logo? Just for fun. ðŸ˜Š
